# Software Agents: Automated Software Development Team

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) An automated multi-agent system built using CrewAI that simulates a software development team to break down problems, write code, and review it.


## Overview

Software-Agents demonstrates the power of collaborative AI agents for tackling software development tasks. This project sets up a team of three specialized agents:

1.  **Project Manager:** Analyzes and breaks down complex software problems or requirements into smaller, executable tasks suitable for a developer.
2.  **Software Engineer:** Takes the defined tasks and writes the corresponding software code.
3.  **Code Reviewer / QA Tester:** Reviews the code generated by the engineer, potentially based on executing tests or analyzing the code against requirements, to ensure quality and correctness.

This system aims to automate the initial cycle of understanding requirements, implementing a solution, and performing a basic review.

*This project was initially developed as part of the AI Tinkerers Seattle hackathon on June 15th, 2024.*

## Features

* **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Utilizes CrewAI framework for seamless interaction between specialized agents.
* **Automated Task Breakdown:** Manager agent intelligently decomposes complex problems.
* **Automated Code Generation:** Engineer agent writes code based on defined tasks.
* **Automated Code Review/Testing:** Reviewer agent provides feedback on the generated code.
* **Local LLM Integration:**  Designed to work with local LLMs via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., LM Studio).

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** CrewAI
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **LLM Interaction:** LangChain (with ChatOpenAI wrapper, based on previous context)
* **Local LLM Server:** (e.g., LM Studio, Ollama - specify if known)
* **Core LLM:** (e.g., Llama 3 8B Instruct GGUF - specify if known)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+
    * Access to a running LLM (e.g., LM Studio serving a compatible model). Ensure the model specified in `agents.py` is loaded and the server is running at the configured URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234/v1`).
    * (Optional: Git for cloning)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Software-Agents.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/Software-Agents.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd Software-Agents
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Make sure you have a requirements.txt file!
    ```

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Edit the `.env` file if necessary (though for LM Studio, the API key is often a placeholder and the URL is key).

## Usage

1.  **Define the Problem:** Modify the `QUESTION`, `EXAMPLE`, and `CONSTRAINTS` variables within `main.py` to specify the software problem you want the agents to solve.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Output:** The script will log the interactions between the agents and print the final result produced by the crew (which might be the reviewed code, test results, or a summary report depending on your final task). Check the console output for detailed logs (set `verbose=2` in `Crew` initialization in `main.py` for maximum detail).

## How it Works

(Optional: Add more detail here about the specific prompts used for each agent or the exact flow of information between tasks if desired).

The `main.py` script orchestrates the process:
1.  Initializes the Agents (Manager, Developer, Tester) using configurations from `agents.py`, connecting to the specified LLM.
2.  Defines the Tasks (Breakdown, Code, Test) using `tasks.py`, assigning them to the appropriate agents and setting up dependencies (`context`).
3.  Creates a `Crew` object with the agents and tasks.
4.  `crew.kickoff()` starts the process, running tasks sequentially based on their defined context dependencies.
